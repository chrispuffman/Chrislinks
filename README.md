In twilight's embrace, the moon whispers,
A secret melody to the silent stars.
They dance, their celestial waltz,
Painting the night canvas with cosmic hues.

The wind, a mischievous muse,
Sings through ancient branches,
Telling tales of forgotten realms,
Where dragons slumber and fairies weep.

And as dawn tiptoes across the horizon,
The world stirs from its dreams,
Leaving behind the magic of night,
Yet carrying its echoes in every dew-kissed petal.
