And as dawn tiptoes across the horizon,
The world stirs from its dreams,
Leaving behind the magic of night,
Yet carrying its echoes in every dew-kissed petal.

In twilight's embrace, the moon whispers,
A secret melody to the silent stars.
They dance, their celestial waltz,
Painting the night canvas with cosmic hues.

The wind, a mischievous muse,
Sings through ancient branches,
Telling tales of forgotten realms,
Where dragons slumber and fairies weep.
